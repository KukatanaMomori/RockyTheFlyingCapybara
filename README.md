# RockyTheFlyingCapybara

You play as a capybara with rockets (these are only for flying), recharge them by eating, evade enemies like anacondas and caimans (similar to alligators)  and go through rough platforming to reach your friends that are relaxing at a hot spring.

Don't fly too high because you will remain out of fuel and your fat capybara will fall on the ground.
